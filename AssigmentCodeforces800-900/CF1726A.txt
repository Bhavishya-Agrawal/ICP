-> We are given an array of integers of size n.

-> We can perform the following operation one time only:
	
	- We can take a subarray of boundaries l and r and cyclically rotate it k times. l,r and k are chosen by us for optimal solution.

-> Goal: To modify the array such that arr[n-1] - arr[0] is maximized.

Optimal Approach:

- There are three possible scenarios to find the maximum difference.

1) Keeping the element at arr[0] as is, we cyclically rotate the rest of the array to maximize the difference between arr[n-1] and arr[0].

This is the formal language, but we're just going to find the maximum possible difference between arr[0] and rest of the elements as we can rotate n number of times to make it possible and we only gotta print the difference not the array, so there's no need to manually rotate the array.

2) Keeping the element at arr[n-1] as is, we cyclically rotate the rest of the array to maximize the difference between arr[n-1] and arr[0].

This is the formal language, but we're just going to find the maximum possible difference between arr[n-1] and rest of the elements as we can rotate n number of times to make it possible and we only gotta print the difference not the array, so there's no need to manually rotate the array.

3) as we can rotate the array n steps, that means every number has the possibility of becoming arr[0]. so we find the difference between every number arr[i] and arr[(i+n-1)%n](this is to keep the index within bounds and rotate) while iterating through the array. We take the maximum difference we found.

Whichever value is greater between the steps (1),(2) and (3), we print that as the answer.


Optimal Solution:

import java.util.*;
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner scn=new Scanner(System.in);
        int t=scn.nextInt();
        while(t-->0){
            int n=scn.nextInt();
            int[] arr=new int[n];
            for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
                arr[i]=scn.nextInt();
            }
            if(n == 1){
                System.out.println(0);
                continue;
            }
            int maxright=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            int maxleft=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
                maxright=Math.max(maxright,arr[i]-arr[0]);
            }
            for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++){
                maxleft=Math.max(maxleft,arr[n-1]-arr[i]);
            }
            int maxdiff=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
                maxdiff=Math.max(maxdiff,arr[(i+n-1)%n]-arr[i]);
            }
            int ans=Math.max(maxdiff,Math.max(maxright,maxleft));
            System.out.println(ans);
        }
    }
